## Introduction

Brute-force attacks involve an attacker trying many username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to a service like FTP. Since FTP transmits data in plain text, these attacks can often be identified by analyzing network traffic.

In this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through how I used Wireshark to detect a brute-force FTP attack. We‚Äôll cover how to filter traffic, recognize suspicious patterns, and confirm whether the attacker successfully logged in‚Äîall in a simple, step-by-step way.

> üìù **Note:** When analyzing logs or packet captures, it‚Äôs easy to feel overwhelmed. To stay focused, always ask:
>
> 1. **What am I looking for?** Are you investigating a login anomaly, malware activity, or data exfiltration?
> 2. **When did it happen?** Narrowing the timeframe helps reduce noise.
> 3. **Where should I look?** Focus on relevant systems, protocols, or hosts.
> 4. **What can I ignore?** Filter out normal, known-good activity.

## Filtering FTP Traffic

The first step is to filter for FTP traffic using `ftp` as the display filter.

As shown in the image above, we filtered the traffic to only show FTP packets‚Äî184 out of 370 packets‚Äîhelping reduce noise and focus on the relevant data.

## Repetitive Login Attempts

Brute-force behavior is evident when you see multiple `USER` and `PASS` commands within a short time span, especially from the same source IP.

Use the following filters:

```wireshark
ftp.request.command == "PASS"
ftp.response.code == 530
```

![Failed Login Attempts](/blog-images/hydra/failed_login.PNG)

The image above shows several failed login attempts occurring within seconds‚Äîclear signs of an automated brute-force tool.

![User and Password Attempts](/blog-images/hydra/user-pass.PNG)

You can also see the list of attempted usernames and passwords, along with server responses indicating login failures.

![Response Details](/blog-images/hydra/faled.PNG)

The response code `530` and message ‚ÄúUser napier not logged in‚Äù confirms authentication failures.

## Identifying a Successful Login

To check for a successful login, use the filter:

```wireshark
ftp.response.code == 230
```

![Successful Login](/blog-images/hydra/user-login.PNG)

Here, we see that the user ‚Äúadministrator‚Äù successfully logged in. The response code `230` confirms the login was accepted.

To determine the password used, follow the TCP stream:

![Follow TCP Stream](/blog-images/hydra/login-follow-stream.PNG)

In this case, the password used was `napier`. Since FTP transmits data in plain text, all credentials are visible in the packet capture.

> üîê Once a successful login is confirmed, the security team should immediately isolate the affected system and begin incident response procedures.

## üîç Useful Wireshark Filters for FTP

### Basic FTP Commands

| Filter                              | Purpose                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `ftp`                               | Show all FTP protocol packets           |
| `ftp.request`                       | Show FTP client commands                |
| `ftp.response`                      | Show FTP server responses               |
| `ftp.request.command == "USER"`     | Filter only USER commands               |
| `ftp.request.command == "PASS"`     | Filter only PASS (password) commands    |
| `ftp.response.code == 230`          | Show successful logins                  |
| `ftp.response.code == 530`          | Show failed login attempts              |
| `ftp.response.code == 550`          | Show file access denied errors          |

### Data Transfer-Related

FTP uses two channels:
- **Control**: TCP port 21 (commands)
- **Data**: Random port (file transfers)

| Filter                              | Purpose                                     |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `tcp.port == 21`                    | Show control channel traffic                |
| `ftp-data`                          | Show data transfer sessions                 |
| `tcp.port == 20`                    | Active mode file transfer source port       |
| `ftp.request.command == "STOR"`     | Show file upload attempts                   |
| `ftp.request.command == "RETR"`     | Show file download attempts                 |
