# Must-Know Heuristic Techniques for Security Analysts

In cybersecurity, signature-based detection alone is no longer enough. Modern malware evolves too quickly, using obfuscation, packing, and polymorphic techniques to evade traditional defenses. That‚Äôs where **heuristic analysis** comes in ‚Äî instead of looking for exact matches, heuristics look for **suspicious patterns and behaviors** that *hint at malicious activity*.  

In this post, we‚Äôll go through **heuristic techniques** that every security analyst should know. These techniques span filesystems, processes, networks, memory, persistence mechanisms, code imports, and even user behavior. Think of this as a **cheat sheet for detecting the subtle clues attackers leave behind**.

## üìÇ Filesystem Heuristics

Attackers often drop or disguise files in unusual locations. Recognizing where files appear on disk, and how they are named, can be an immediate red flag.

For example, malware staging in `C:\Windows\Temp\` or `C:\ProgramData\` is common because these folders are writable by normal users. If you suddenly see an executable in `C:\Users\Public\`, it may be trying to run under multiple accounts without raising suspicion.  

Some files masquerade with **double extensions** like `invoice.pdf.exe`, or use **Unicode homoglyphs** such as `expl–ærer.exe` (with a Cyrillic ‚Äúo‚Äù) to fool the eye. Other times, attackers create files with **random names** like `as9dh2.exe` or time-stamped names at odd hours such as `backup-202308.exe`.  

A classic real-world case is the **ILOVEYOU worm** (2000), which spread by dropping a `.vbs` file disguised as a love letter. Today‚Äôs malware may do the same with ‚Äúupdates‚Äù or ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù that carry unexpected extensions.  

Even subtler clues include executables hiding in browser cache folders, malicious code hiding in **alternate data streams**, or repeated execution of files from Downloads or Desktop folders. If you notice **20 KB ‚Äúinstallers‚Äù** or **hosts file modifications**, you‚Äôre looking at filesystem heuristics in action.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process & Execution Heuristics

Malware rarely hides forever at some point, it executes. The way processes behave often reveals their true nature.  

If `svchost.exe` is running outside of `System32`, or if `winword.exe` suddenly spawns `powershell.exe`, something is off. Browsers like Chrome should never be spawning `malware.exe`. Similarly, a `notepad.exe` instance launching `cmd.exe` is a clear anomaly.  

Attackers often use **LOLbins** (Living-Off-the-Land binaries) such as `certutil.exe` or `mshta.exe` to download and run malicious payloads without dropping obvious files. In 2017, **FIN7** famously abused `mshta.exe` to execute JavaScript-based malware delivered via phishing.  

Other heuristics include long-lived PowerShell processes (legit ones are short), strange command-line arguments like **huge Base64 blobs**, or PowerShell running with `-EncodedCommand`. If you see AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) being disabled via reflection, that‚Äôs a huge red flag.  

More advanced cases include **process hollowing** (legit processes like `svchost.exe` carrying injected malicious code) and **DLL sideloading** by trusted apps.  

Bottom line: when parent-child relationships look wrong or when binaries are running from the wrong path, you‚Äôve likely caught an attacker in the act.

## üåê Network Heuristics

On the wire, attackers leave trails too. Even when encrypted, the **shape** of the traffic often betrays them.  

Random-looking domains generated by DGAs (Domain Generation Algorithms) can appear in DNS logs. If you see beacons pinging out every 10 or 30 seconds like clockwork, that‚Äôs likely command-and-control (C2) traffic. Malware like **Conficker** made thousands of random DNS requests daily to find its C2 servers.  

Outbound connections to rare ports (like TCP/4444) or encrypted traffic on non-HTTPS ports are suspicious. ICMP packets with large payloads can hide data exfiltration, while DNS TXT records may be abused to smuggle credentials.  

From a defender‚Äôs perspective, a Word document making an external HTTP request is not normal behavior. JA3 fingerprint mismatches during TLS handshakes or HTTPS sessions with self-signed certificates are other classic giveaways.  

Modern ransomware campaigns also love **long-lived TCP sessions with minimal data transfer** (heartbeat-style beacons) before launching their attack. If multiple endpoints suddenly talk to the same new domain registered within the last 30 days, alarms should be ringing.

## üß† Memory & Code Execution Heuristics

Malware often lives in memory to avoid detection on disk. Analysts can look for **unbacked executable memory regions**, **RWX (read-write-execute) memory pages**, or **high-entropy blobs** indicating packed shellcode.  

When attackers inject into processes like `lsass.exe` (to steal credentials), you‚Äôll find anomalous memory regions or reflective DLL injection artifacts. Techniques like **process hollowing** or **inline hooking** of system DLLs are also key heuristics.  

A famous case is **Mimikatz**, which directly interacts with LSASS memory to dump credentials. If you see unbacked memory regions mapped into LSASS, you‚Äôve likely caught credential theft in progress.

## üóùÔ∏è Registry & Persistence Heuristics

Persistence is the attacker‚Äôs way of ensuring they survive reboots. Registry keys are often the first target.  

Look for modifications in `Run` or `RunOnce` startup keys, strange services registered in the Services hive, or unusual scheduled tasks. WMI event subscriptions and COM hijacking are also used to maintain stealthy persistence.  

Attackers may also encode payloads in Base64 and store them in registry values a trick seen in **fileless malware** campaigns. Even something as odd as a `.scr` file configured as a screensaver can be malicious persistence.  

From a heuristic standpoint, registry modifications occurring outside working hours or keys hijacked to point `.exe` launches to malware should raise immediate suspicion.

---

## üìö Code & Import Heuristics

When you look inside executables, the imported functions tell a story.  

If a calculator app is importing `wininet.dll` or `CryptEncrypt`, something is off. Malware often uses **rare API imports** like `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, and `CreateRemoteThread` for injection.  

Another red flag is when binaries import only one or two functions (a minimal stub), or when they use `GetProcAddress` to dynamically resolve APIs. This is often done to hide malicious intent until runtime.  

A simple but real example: a fake installer statically linked with networking libraries, even though it claims to be an offline tool. These mismatches are exactly what heuristic analysis is designed to catch.

---

## üë§ User & Behavior Heuristics

Finally, attackers reveal themselves by how they interact with systems and users.  

Executables run at odd hours (like 3 AM), the same file running under multiple accounts, or binaries spreading across many hosts signal lateral movement. Abnormal login patterns, such as impossible travel (a user logging in from Nigeria and the U.S. within minutes), should raise alerts.  

Ransomware is notorious for suddenly encrypting large volumes of files a heuristic that modern EDR systems use for detection. Likewise, non-UI processes accessing the clipboard (for credential theft) or temporary accounts escalating privileges are red flags.  

Real-world example: in **NotPetya**, once inside a network, the malware spread rapidly using stolen credentials, causing the same binary to appear across multiple departments in minutes. Heuristics like these help defenders spot unusual propagation before damage spreads.

# Conclusion

Heuristic techniques are not about catching malware by name, but by **catching it by behavior**. Whether it‚Äôs a strange file path, an unusual parent-child process chain, or suspicious network beaconing, these small clues can add up to a major incident detection.  

By mastering these **100 heuristics**, analysts strengthen their ability to see beyond signatures and identify the subtle patterns attackers leave behind. In a world of evolving threats, heuristics remain one of the most powerful allies in the defender‚Äôs toolkit.
